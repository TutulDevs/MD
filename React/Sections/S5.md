# Section 5 | 6 June 


### Keys

* If we don't give key to lists, React will then update or re-evaluate the whole DOM node and it's a performance hazard. 
* We can also lose data if we don't give key.
* Via keys, React keeps a track of the current element and update the list likewise.
* It is discouraged to use index from Array.map(), because that may occur bug.
