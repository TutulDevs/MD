# Section 8 | 7 June 

* Two way binding is more efficient for form than e.target.reset() while resetting.
* Use modal  with ease by creating the state empty then give objects and on click make the state null again. Reusabel modal is done!
* On the parent component, get the inputs inside a array state `useState([])`. 
* Then update the state on form submit with previous objs and add the new values.
