# Section 13 | Class Based React

## 166 - Lifecycle component

| Method | Work | Equivalent |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `componentDidMount()` | Called once when the component mounted | `useEffect()` with empty `[]` |
| `componentDidUpdate()` | Called once when it's updated | `useEffect()` with some value as dependency | 
| `componentWillUnmount()` | Called right before component unmounted | `useEffect()` with a cleanup `return` function |


## 170 - Error Boundary

* It only works in `class` based.
* A typical `ErrorBoundary` would like this: 

```js
import React, { Component} from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  componentDidCatch() {}

  render () {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

* Inside the `componetDidCatch()` we can deal with the errors and the actions.
* It will take a param as the error.
* Inside the `class` we can create state and other `class` things.
* To use it, simply wrap the the component which my throw an error.
